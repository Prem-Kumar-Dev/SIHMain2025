python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2) Run the minimal scheduler demo:
```powershell
python -m src.main

# AI-Powered Train Traffic Control for Indian Railways

## 1\. Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) to maximize section throughput and optimize train traffic control for Indian Railways. The current system relies heavily on the manual, experience-based decisions of Section Controllers, which is becoming increasingly insufficient due to rising traffic density and network complexity.[1, 2]

This AI-powered system will transition the paradigm from manual and reactive control to a data-driven, predictive, and optimized framework. It will assist controllers by providing real-time predictions, identifying potential conflicts, and recommending optimal, conflict-free schedules to enhance efficiency, safety, and punctuality.[1, 3]

## 2\. System Architecture

The system is designed with a modular, multi-layered architecture. The core philosophy is **augmented intelligence**, where the AI assists the human controller, who retains final authority.[4, 5, 6]

The architecture consists of four primary layers:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Integration Layer**: The system's sensory interface. It connects to various railway data sources, cleans and standardizes the data, and feeds it into the system.[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
2.  **Digital Twin & Simulation Environment**: The heart of the system. It maintains a high-fidelity, real-time virtual model of the railway network. This serves as the single source of truth for the AI and a sandbox for "what-if" analysis.[8, 12, 13, 14]
3.  **AI Core (Prediction & Optimization Engines)**: The "brain" of the DSS. It processes data from the Digital Twin to forecast future states and generate optimized operational plans.[15, 16]
4.  **Controller Command & Control Interface (C3I)**: The frontend HMI through which the controller interacts with the system, visualizes data, and acts on AI-driven recommendations.[17, 18, 4]

## 3\. Technology Stack

This project will leverage a modern, Python-based stack suitable for data science, machine learning, and real-time applications.

  * **Backend Language**: Python 3.9+
  * **API Framework**: FastAPI / Flask
  * **Data Processing**:
      * Pandas, NumPy
      * Apache NiFi (for managing complex data pipelines) [8]
  * **Databases**:
      * **Time-Series**: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (for high-frequency train position data)
      * **Data Warehouse**: PostgreSQL or a cloud-based solution (for historical data, timetables)
  * **AI & Machine Learning**:
      * **Core Libraries**: TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch
      * **GNNs**: PyTorch Geometric (PyG) or Deep Graph Library (DGL)
      * **General ML**: Scikit-learn [19]
      * **RL**: Stable Baselines3, RLlib
  * **Optimization**:
      * **Constraint Programming**: Google OR-Tools [20]
      * **MILP Solvers**: PuLP (wrapper), with solvers like CBC, Gurobi, or CPLEX
      * **Metaheuristics**: Libraries like `geneticalgorithm`, `simanneal`, or custom implementations.
  * **Frontend (C3I)**:
      * **Framework**: React or Vue.js
      * **Visualization**: D3.js, Vis.js (for time-distance graphs), Mapbox/Leaflet (for geographic maps)
  * **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## 4\. Project Structure

A modular structure is proposed to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

## 5\. Data Sources & Schema

The system requires access to diverse, real-time, and static data sources.

| Data Category | Potential Sources / Feeds | Format | Update Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Train Position** | Live Train Status APIs (e.g., RailRadar API) [21, 22], Train Describer (TD) [23, 24] | JSON/XML | Real-time |
| **Train Events** | TRUST Feed, Live Status APIs [23, 22] | JSON/XML | Real-time |
| **Timetables** | Official Schedule Feeds, GTFS/GTFS-RT [25, 26, 27] | CIF, JSON, TXT | Daily / Real-time |
| **Infrastructure** | IR Planning Systems, railML [28], Public GIS Data | XML, JSON | As updated |
| **External Data** | Weather APIs, Public Event Calendars | JSON | Real-time/Hourly |

#### **API Integration:**

Initial development can leverage public APIs for Indian Railways data. The **RailRadar API** is a strong candidate.[22]

  * **Base URL**: `https://railradar.in/api/v1`
  * **Authentication**: Requires an `x-api-key` header.
  * **Key Endpoints**:
      * `GET /trains/live-map`: Real-time position of all running trains.
      * `GET /trains/{trainNumber}/schedule`: Detailed schedule for a specific train.
      * `GET /trains/between`: Find all trains between two stations.

## 6\. Backend Modules & Functionalities (Development Roadmap)

This section outlines the core components to be built for the backend.

#### **Module 1: Data Ingestion**

  * **Task 1.1: API Connectors**: Implement Python clients to fetch data from railway APIs (e.g., RailRadar) and weather APIs.
  * **Task 1.2: Data Parsers**: Create functions to parse and standardize incoming data (GTFS, JSON) into a unified internal schema.
  * **Task 1.3: Data Storage**: Write scripts to load processed data into the appropriate databases (time-series data into InfluxDB, static/historical data into PostgreSQL).

#### **Module 2: Digital Twin**

  * **Task 2.1: Network Graph Model**: Use a library like `networkx` to represent the railway network. Nodes will be stations, signals, and junctions. Edges will be track segments with attributes like length, speed limit, and block status.
  * **Task 2.2: State Management**: Develop a class to manage the real-time state of the network, updating train positions, signal aspects, and track occupancy based on ingested data.
  * **Task 2.3: Simulation Engine**: Implement a discrete-time simulation loop that can project future train movements based on current state, physics, and signaling rules (Absolute Block System).[29] This is crucial for "what-if" analysis.

#### **Module 3: AI Core - Predictive Engine**

  * **Task 3.1: GNN for State Representation**: Build a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HetGNN) using PyG/DGL. The model will learn embeddings for trains and stations that capture complex network interactions.[30, 31]
  * **Task 3.2: Delay Prediction Model**: Use the GNN embeddings as features for a downstream model (e.g., MLP, LSTM) to predict train delays at future points in their journey.[32, 33, 34, 19]
  * **Task 3.3: Conflict Detection**: Write logic that uses the predicted trajectories from the simulation engine to identify potential future conflicts (e.g., two trains predicted to occupy the same block section).

#### **Module 4: AI Core - Optimization Engine**

  * **Task 4.1: Constraint Satisfaction Model**: Using Google OR-Tools, define the hard constraints of the railway system (e.g., a track segment can only be occupied by one train at a time).[35, 36, 20, 4] This module will validate the feasibility of any proposed schedule.
  * **Task 4.2: Real-time Rescheduling (Metaheuristics)**: Implement a **Genetic Algorithm** or **Simulated Annealing** to resolve predicted conflicts.[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] The algorithm will search for a new, near-optimal schedule (e.g., by adjusting hold times or overtakes) that minimizes the primary KPI (total delay).
  * **Task 4.3 (Advanced): Reinforcement Learning**: Develop a MARL environment using the Digital Twin. Each train can be an agent that learns an optimal dispatching policy to navigate the network and avoid conflicts.[43, 15, 44, 16, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]

#### **Module 5: Backend API**

  * **Task 5.1: Expose System State**: Create endpoints to provide the C3I frontend with real-time data from the Digital Twin.
  * **Task 5.2: Deliver AI Insights**: Develop endpoints that serve predictions, identified conflicts, and the optimized schedules generated by the AI Core.
  * **Task 5.3: Enable "What-If" Scenarios**: Create an endpoint that allows the frontend to submit a hypothetical action (e.g., "hold train X for 5 mins") and returns the simulated outcome.
