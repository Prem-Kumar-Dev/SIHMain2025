# High-Level Workflow and Architecture

## 1. Data Ingestion & Integration
- Collect real-time and historical data from signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock, and IoT sensors via secure APIs.

## 2. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Clean, validate, and transform raw data into features for optimization and AI models.

## 3. Optimization & AI Engine
- Core module for real-time train scheduling, precedence, and crossing decisions.
- Uses operations research (e.g., integer programming) and AI (e.g., reinforcement learning) to generate conflict-free, feasible schedules.
- Supports rapid re-optimization under disruptions.

## 4. Simulation & Scenario Analysis
- Enables what-if analysis for alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations.
- Digital twin for virtual testing.

## 5. User Interface (UI)
- Dashboard for section controllers with recommendations, explanations, and override options.
- Visualizes schedules, conflicts, KPIs, and audit trails.

## 6. Integration Layer
- Secure APIs for communication with existing railway control systems and data sources.

## 7. Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
- Performance dashboards, KPIs (punctuality, delay, throughput), and audit logs for feedback and system tuning.

**Next Steps:**
- Break down each component into detailed modules and define responsibilities.
- Plan the tech stack and tools for each module.
