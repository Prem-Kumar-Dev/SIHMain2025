Of course. Based on your excellent progress, you've successfully built the foundational "reactive" component of the system. The next logical and most impactful step is to build the **Predictive Engine**. This will transform your application from a system that can solve current problems to an intelligent one that can foresee and prevent future problems.

Here is a detailed `nextStep.md` file that outlines the roadmap for this phase. It's structured to be highly actionable for development, especially when using an AI coding assistant.

# `nextStep.md`: Building the Predictive Engine

## 1. Objective

The current system is a powerful optimization engine that can generate an optimal schedule based on a given set of inputs. The next phase is to evolve this into a proactive Decision Support System (DSS).

The primary goal is to build a **Predictive Engine** that can:
1.  Forecast the future state of the railway network (e.g., 30-60 minutes ahead).
2.  Identify potential conflicts and delays *before* they occur.
3.  Feed these predicted conflicts into the existing MILP solver for targeted, real-time resolution.

This moves the system from reactive scheduling to proactive, intelligent traffic management.

## 2. Development Roadmap

This phase is broken down into four key modules. It is recommended to build them in this order.

### **Module 1: Data Acquisition & Feature Engineering**

The quality of any prediction model depends on the quality of its input data. This module focuses on gathering real-world data and transforming it into features the model can learn from.

#### **Task 1.1: Integrate Real-Time & Historical Data Sources**
Your current system uses static scenario data. To make predictions, we need dynamic data.

*   **Primary Data Source**: Integrate a real-time API for Indian Railways. The **RailRadar API** is a comprehensive choice that provides live train status, schedules, and historical delay analytics.[1]
    *   **API Base URL**: `https://railradar.in/api/v1` [1]
    *   **Authentication**: Requires an `x-api-key` in the request header.[1]
    *   **Key Endpoints**:
        *   `GET /trains/live-map`: For the current state of all trains.
        *   `GET /trains/{trainNumber}/average-delay`: For historical delay data.
        *   `GET /trains/{trainNumber}/schedule`: For static schedule information.

*   **Secondary Data Source**: Use public datasets for initial model training and historical analysis. The **Indian Railways Dataset on Kaggle** provides static schedules and station information in JSON format, which is ideal for building the initial network graph.

#### **Task 1.2: Feature Engineering**
Create a Python script (`src/ai_core/predictive_engine/feature_engineering.py`) to process the raw data into a rich feature set. For each train at a given time, extract the following features:
*   **Train-Specific Features**: `priority`, `train_type` (e.g., passenger, freight), `total_route_length`, `remaining_stops`.
*   **Dynamic Features**: `current_delay_minutes`, `time_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `scheduled_dwell_time_at_next_station`.
*   **Network Topological Features**: `traffic_density_in_section` (number of trains in the same block), `upcoming_track_type` (e.g., single vs. double line).
*   **Historical Features**: `avg_delay_for_this_train_on_this_section` (from the RailRadar API or your own historical run data). This is a very powerful predictor.[2]
*   **External Features (Optional but Recommended)**: Integrate a free weather API to get `precipitation` and `visibility` for the train's location, as these affect performance.

### **Module 2: Generate a Training Dataset**

Your simulator is a powerful tool for generating the large, labeled dataset required for supervised learning.

*   **Task 2.1: Create a Simulation Data Generation Script**:
    1.  Load a base scenario into your existing simulator.
    2.  Introduce random "disturbances" by applying small initial delays to a random subset of trains.
    3.  Run your MILP solver to get the final, optimized schedule.
    4.  For each train, log the initial feature vector (from Module 1) and the final outcome (the `lateness` from your KPI report).
    5.  Repeat this process thousands of times to create a comprehensive `training_data.csv` file.

### **Module 3: Develop the Predictive AI Core (GNN)**

A railway network is a classic graph problem. A **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** is the state-of-the-art approach for learning from this kind of interconnected data, as it can capture the complex interactions between trains and stations that simpler models cannot.

*   **Task 3.1: Model the Network as a Heterogeneous Graph**:
    *   Use a library like **PyTorch Geometric (PyG)**.
    *   Define different node and edge types to capture the full context of the railway system. The **SAGE-Het** architecture is a proven model for this exact problem.
    *   **Node Types**:
        *   `RunningTrain`: Features include dynamic data like current speed and delay.
        *   `Station`: Features include static data like `platform_capacity`.
        *   `TerminatedTrain`: A train that has finished its journey but may still affect network congestion.
    *   **Edge Types (Metapaths)**:
        *   `(RunningTrain) -> (RunningTrain)`: Represents the headway relationship between consecutive trains.
        *   `(Station) -> (RunningTrain)`: Represents a train approaching a station.
        *   `(Station) -> (Station)`: Represents the physical track connection.

*   **Task 3.2: Build and Train the Prediction Model**:
    1.  **GNN for Feature Extraction**: The SAGE-Het model will process the graph and learn a rich, context-aware embedding (a feature vector) for each `RunningTrain` node.
    2.  **Downstream Prediction Model**: Feed these embeddings into a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) or LSTM network to predict the final delay in minutes.[2, 3, 4]
    3.  **Training**: Train this end-to-end model on the dataset generated in Module 2. The loss function will be Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted delay and the actual delay from the simulation.
    4.  **Save the Model**: Save the trained model weights to a file (e.g., `predictive_model.pth`).

### **Module 4: Integration with Existing System**

This module connects the new predictive capabilities to your existing optimization workflow.

*   **Task 4.1: Create a `/predict` API Endpoint**:
    *   This endpoint will accept a real-time network state (similar to the input for `/schedule`).
    *   It will load the trained model, construct the graph, and run a forward pass to get predicted delays for all trains over the next 30 minutes.
    *   It will then analyze these predicted trajectories to identify future conflicts (e.g., two trains predicted to need the same single-track section at the same time).
    *   The endpoint will return a list of these predicted conflicts.

*   **Task 4.2: Modify the Main Application Logic**:
    *   Instead of calling the MILP solver on the entire schedule, the primary workflow will now be:
        1.  Call the `/predict` endpoint to get a list of future conflicts.
        2.  If no conflicts are predicted, the current schedule is stable.
        3.  If conflicts are predicted, pass a *reduced problem* to the `/schedule` endpoint. This problem will contain only the trains and sections involved in the predicted conflict.
    *   This makes your powerful MILP solver much faster and more effective for real-time use, as it's now solving smaller, targeted problems.

## 3. Definition of Done for This Phase

This phase will be considered complete when:
*   A trained and validated GNN-based predictive model is saved as a deployable artifact.
*   The backend has a new `/predict` endpoint that can forecast delays and identify conflicts.
*   The main application logic is updated to use the predictive engine to proactively identify and resolve future bottlenecks using the existing MILP solver.
*   The Streamlit UI has a new visualization that shows the AI's *predicted* train paths alongside the scheduled and actual paths, highlighting potential future conflicts.

## 4. Next Step After This Phase

Once the Predictive Engine is complete, the next logical step is to explore **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. An RL agent can be trained in your Digital Twin to learn an optimal, near-instantaneous dispatching policy. This can serve as a high-speed alternative to the MILP solver for handling large-scale, cascading disruptions where decision speed is the top priority.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
